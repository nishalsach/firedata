# Forest Fire Prediction Using LSTM Networks

In this day and age of rapid climate change, how can researchers use scalable Machine Learning models and temporal weather data to improve predictions for forest fires? 

Over my spring semester in 2018, I worked with [Dr. Rajiv Chaturvedi](https://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/rajivc/Profile) at BITS Goa, and remotely collaborated with [Dr. Jaideep Joshi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1kJzNuMAAAAJ&hl=en) from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc Bangalore) to answer this question. We built  different ANN and LSTM models that can help to predict burnt forest area, by training on the [Global Fire Emissions Database](https://www.globalfiredata.org). This is the GitHub repository for our LSTM model.
